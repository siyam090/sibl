           Twenty four years ago, the founders of our bank have started a journey with a firm conviction for the wellbeing of our society to which we owe a lot. Over the years, we have been able to spread our activities across the country through active particiaption. <br>

We may take pride that we are contributing to the national economy through our banking activities. We are generating
 revenue, we are helping to generate revenue, we are facilitating foreign trade and we are creating employment 
 opportunities. Over the years, we have seen vibrant presence of our Bank in the industry and financial indicators
  are also soaring. We have also become successful preserving our brand’s vitality and identity to ensuring customers’ 
  loyalty over time. <br>
</p>

<p>
SIBL is the first bank among Islami Banks to introduce on-line banking for providing prompt and secured services.
 This is also ahead in respect of transparency, accountability, quality services in all its banking activities. 
 We have introduced modern products and services breaking the conventional banking norms. <br>
</p>
<p>
We have extended our activities in all spheres of financial inclusion. We have micro-finance and family empowerment program which is unique in the country. Under this program the grass roots can avail investment as an individual or in group without any collateral. Through this we are extending financial support to grass root people and trying to bring solvency in the ultra-poor families. We have financed some 9443 ultra-poor families who had no access to any financial institutions previously. The total outstanding is Tk.36.74 crore as of October 2019 which has seen 44% rise 
year on year. We believe in a truly empowered Bangladesh making the marginal families financially empowered. <br>
</p>
<p>
We are going to land our footprint in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia very soon. Opening a branch will create 
opportunities for expatriates living and working there to avail banking services from a native bank. <br>
</p>
<p>
Our journey towards excellence is neither a myth nor just a slogan, it’s a path we tread. SIBL will continue
 to strengthen its presence in the industry to be the most complete Bank by its relentless pursuit. <br>
